    "Overall, we can see that overall undergraduate GPAs have increased at a consistent rate over time, and that as professors continue teaching, they assign fewer low grades. We also saw some spikes in undergraduate GPAs that can be attributed to the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting or the COVID-19 pandemic. Though overall GPAs increased, some GPAs by subject remained consistent relative to each other, such as MATH consistently being a subject with the lowest grades given for the last 20 years. We couldn't draw a conclusion to determine if students chose their major based on average salary after graduation, though we were able to observe an increase of enrollments within STEM related intro courses such as Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. Finally, we saw that Virginia Tech has made an effort to increase diversity, and has doubled enrollment of Hispanics of any race, and increased enrollment of Asians and Black or African American students by a large amount.\n",
